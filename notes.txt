It's not possible to document all the functions without parsing the JS.
Instead, make it VERY EASY to write documentation.

output in json

blocks look like this
    /**
    *
    */

blocks have
    * source file
    * source line #

support documenting functions only (for now)

functions have
    * name (pick up automatically)
    * description (optional)
    * params (optional)
    * return (optional)
